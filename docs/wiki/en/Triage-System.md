## Overview

Aphelion's Triage System ensures that the right level of rigor is applied based on project characteristics:

- A **personal CLI tool** gets Minimal — just enough to ship
- A **public OSS library** gets Full — the complete quality pipeline
- Everything else falls somewhere in between

The triage happens at the start of each flow. The orchestrator interviews the user (or reads `DISCOVERY_RESULT.md`) and selects from 4 plan tiers: **Minimal**, **Light**, **Standard**, or **Full**.

---

## How Triage Works

1. The flow orchestrator interviews the user using `AskUserQuestion` on project characteristics (or reads `DISCOVERY_RESULT.md`)
2. The orchestrator presents the selected plan and agent list as text output
3. The orchestrator asks for approval via `AskUserQuestion`
4. Once approved, agents are launched in sequence

**Assessment dimensions:**
- Project scale (personal script → team project → large-scale)
- External dependencies and integrations
- Domain complexity (regulatory, compliance)
- Public/private status
- `PRODUCT_TYPE` (service / tool / library / cli)
- `HAS_UI` (whether a user interface is involved)

---

## Discovery Flow Triage

| Plan | Trigger Condition | Agents Launched |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Minimal** | Personal tool / small script | `interviewer` |
| **Light** | Personal side project / multiple features | `interviewer` → `rules-designer` → `scope-planner` |
| **Standard** | External dependencies / existing system integration | `interviewer` → `researcher` → `poc-engineer` → `rules-designer` → `scope-planner` |
| **Full** | Regulated / large-scale / complex | `interviewer` → `researcher` → `poc-engineer` → `concept-validator`* → `rules-designer` → `scope-planner` |

*`concept-validator` only runs if `HAS_UI: true`

### Discovery Phase Sequence by Plan

**Minimal:**
```
Phase 1: Requirements interview  → interviewer  → approval
→ discovery-flow generates DISCOVERY_RESULT.md directly
```

**Light:**
```
Phase 1: Requirements interview  → interviewer    → approval
Phase 2: Rule design             → rules-designer → approval
Phase 3: Scope planning          → scope-planner  → approval → done
```

**Standard:**
```
Phase 1: Requirements interview  → interviewer    → approval
Phase 2: Domain research         → researcher     → approval
Phase 3: Technical PoC           → poc-engineer   → approval
Phase 4: Rule design             → rules-designer → approval
Phase 5: Scope planning          → scope-planner  → approval → done
```

**Full:**
```
Phase 1: Requirements interview  → interviewer       → approval
Phase 2: Domain research         → researcher        → approval
Phase 3: Technical PoC           → poc-engineer      → approval
Phase 4: Concept validation      → concept-validator → approval  [HAS_UI: true only]
Phase 5: Rule design             → rules-designer    → approval
Phase 6: Scope planning          → scope-planner     → approval → done
```

## Delivery Flow Triage

| Plan | Trigger Condition | Agents Launched |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Minimal** | Single-function tool | `spec-designer` → `architect` → `developer` → `tester`* → `security-auditor` |
| **Light** | Personal side project | + `ux-designer`† + `test-designer` + `e2e-test-designer`† + `reviewer` |
| **Standard** | Multi-file project | + `scaffolder` + `doc-writer` |
| **Full** | Public project / OSS | + `releaser` |

*In Minimal plan, `tester` integrates test design (TEST_PLAN.md may not be pre-generated)
†Only when `HAS_UI: true`

### Delivery Phase Sequence (Standard Example)

```
Phase 1:  Spec design         → spec-designer      → approval
Phase 2:  UI design           → ux-designer         → approval  [HAS_UI: true only]
Phase 3:  Architecture design → architect          → approval
Phase 4:  Project init        → scaffolder         → approval
Phase 5:  Implementation      → developer          → approval
Phase 6:  Test design         → test-designer      → approval
Phase 7:  E2E test design     → e2e-test-designer  → approval  [HAS_UI: true only]
Phase 8:  Test execution      → tester             → approval
Phase 9:  Code review         → reviewer           → approval
Phase 10: Security audit      → security-auditor   → approval
Phase 11: Documentation       → doc-writer         → approval → done
```

### Side Entry: analyst

`analyst` is not selected through triage — it is a side entry triggered by bug reports, feature requests, or refactoring requests for **existing projects**. After `analyst` completes, `delivery-flow` joins from Phase 3 (architect).

---

## Operations Flow Triage

Operations Flow only runs for `PRODUCT_TYPE: service`. There is no Minimal plan — at minimum, infrastructure definitions and an operations plan are required.

| Plan | Trigger Condition | Agents Launched |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Light** | PaaS / single container / no DB | `infra-builder` → `ops-planner` |
| **Standard** | API + DB architecture | `infra-builder` → `db-ops` → `ops-planner` |
| **Full** | High availability / external user-facing | `infra-builder` → `db-ops` → `observability` → `ops-planner` |

### Operations Assessment Criteria

1. **DB presence**: Whether ARCHITECTURE.md data model and tech stack include a database
2. **User-facing service**: Whether it is an API / Web service accessed by external users
3. **Availability requirements**: Whether uptime requirements or SLAs are specified in SPEC.md

---

## Maintenance Flow Triage

The Maintenance Flow is a **fourth flow independent from Discovery / Delivery / Operations**, invoked manually via `/maintenance-flow` for existing-project maintenance tasks (bug fixes, CVE responses, performance regressions, tech-debt cleanup, small feature extensions). Triage is performed by `change-classifier` based on **4 dimensions**: priority (P1–P4), estimated file count, breaking-change presence, and SPEC.md impact.

| Plan | Trigger Condition | Agents Launched |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Patch** | Bug fix / security patch / 1–3 files / no breaking change | `change-classifier` → `analyst` → `developer` → `tester` |
| **Minor** | Feature addition / refactor / 4–10 files / no breaking change | + `impact-analyzer` → `architect` (differential mode) → `reviewer` |
| **Major** | Breaking change / DB schema change / 11+ files / major SPEC impact | + `security-auditor` → handoff to `delivery-flow` via `MAINTENANCE_RESULT.md` |

`security-auditor` is mandatory only for Major. Patch and Minor may skip it unless trigger type is `security`.

### Maintenance Phase Sequence by Plan

**Patch:**
```
Phase 1: Classification         → change-classifier → approval
Phase 2: Issue creation         → analyst           → approval
Phase 3: Implementation         → developer         → approval
Phase 4: Test execution         → tester            → approval → done
```

**Minor:**
```
Phase 1: Classification         → change-classifier  → approval
Phase 2: Impact analysis        → impact-analyzer    → approval
Phase 3: Issue creation         → analyst            → approval
Phase 4: Differential design    → architect          → approval
Phase 5: Implementation         → developer          → approval
Phase 6: Test execution         → tester             → approval
Phase 7: Review                 → reviewer           → approval → done
```

**Major (handoff to delivery-flow):**
```
Phase 1: Classification         → change-classifier  → approval
Phase 2: Impact analysis        → impact-analyzer    → approval
Phase 3: Issue creation         → analyst            → approval
Phase 4: Pre-audit              → security-auditor   → approval
Phase 5: Handoff                → MAINTENANCE_RESULT.md → delivery-flow
```

### SPEC.md / ARCHITECTURE.md Preconditions

If either is missing at flow start, `change-classifier` proposes inserting `codebase-analyzer` as Phase 0 with user confirmation. After `codebase-analyzer` generates the missing documents, `change-classifier` re-runs classification.

### Handoff File (Major only)

When the plan is Major, `maintenance-flow` generates `MAINTENANCE_RESULT.md` with fields compatible with `DISCOVERY_RESULT.md` (PRODUCT_TYPE, project overview, impact summary). This file is the handoff artifact for `delivery-flow`.

---

## Mandatory Agents (Always Run)

Certain agents run on **all plans** regardless of triage outcome:

| Agent | Domain | Why Mandatory |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| `security-auditor` | Delivery | Security audit cannot be omitted. OWASP Top 10 + dependency scans run even on Minimal |

The `security-auditor` mandate is defined in [.claude/rules/library-and-security-policy.md](../../.claude/rules/library-and-security-policy.md):

> `security-auditor` **must run on all Delivery plans (including Minimal)**.

---

## Conditional Agents (HAS_UI)

Some agents only run when a user interface is involved:

| Agent | Condition | Domain |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| `concept-validator` | Full plan AND `HAS_UI: true` | Discovery |
| `ux-designer` | Any plan AND `HAS_UI: true` | Delivery |
| `e2e-test-designer` | Light/Standard/Full AND `HAS_UI: true` | Delivery |

`HAS_UI` is determined by `interviewer` (Discovery) or `spec-designer` (Delivery direct entry) based on whether the project includes a web UI, mobile app, or desktop GUI.

---

## Triage Assessment Questions

The discovery-flow orchestrator asks the following in two rounds (via `AskUserQuestion`):

**Round 1 (4 questions):**
1. Project scale: personal script / personal side project / team project / large-scale
2. UI type: CLI / API only / Web UI / Mobile
3. External API dependencies: none / present
4. Existing system integration: new / integration with existing

**Round 2 (2 questions):**
5. Domain complexity: simple / moderate / complex (regulated)
6. PRODUCT_TYPE: service / tool / library / cli

---

## Overriding Triage

### Manual Override at Approval Gate

After the orchestrator presents the triage result, users can select "プランを変更" at the approval gate to manually override the plan.

### Auto-Approve Mode Override

The `.aphelion-auto-approve` file can contain plan overrides that skip triage questions:

```
PLAN: Standard
PRODUCT_TYPE: service
HAS_UI: true
```
